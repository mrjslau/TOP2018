  <add key="InitialTutorialMsg" value="Hello, this is a tutorial message. I am your virtual shopping assistant Jenna, but you can call me Jen.        I will be helping you to use ShopLens. It is very simple.        You can either talk to me and I will do all the hard work for you or you can use TalkBack to do all the work yourself.        If you do not want to talk to me, swipe to the left to turn off voice assistant support.        You can turn it back on by swipeing left again.        Let us practice talking for now.        I will now ask you a question. Questions are fun!        After the question you will hear a beep sound. That's your cue to give me an answer.        When you answer, you will hear another beep sound, that indicates that I've heard your answer and that I'm about to act accordingly.        Okay, are you enjoying ShopLens so far, answer yes or no?" />
  <add key="FollowUpTutorialMsg" value="Good. I am enjoying this experience too.         Right now you are in the main menu of ShopLens.        I will now explain what you can do here, in the main menu.        You can say, open shopping cart, to open up your shopping cart. That's where all the items ShopLens has        recognised for you during one shopping session are listed.         If you say, open shopping list, you will be able        to access custom shopping lists you have made yourself. Do not worry, I will help you to modify your shopping lists.        When you say, what is this, you will be able to take a photo of a product and I will identify it for you.        That is, I will tell you the product's name, price and ask you whether you want to add it to your shopping cart or not.        If you say, tutorial, then I will repeat the whole tutorial message for you.        If you forget how to interact with me you can say, remind me, and I will remind you.        If you need information on how to use ShopLens, say help me.        So, what would you have me do?" />
