# TOP2018
C# project for Applied Object-Oriented Programming course.

## The goal
To develop an Android app with C# that would recognise food products and help blind people shop for groceries.

## Prerequisites
Visual Studio 2017/2017 Preview

## Functions of the app in order of realization:
- The ability to recognise specific food products, e.g., tomatoes, a jar of pickles, a box of cereal, a packet of rice and etc.
- Voice command functionality: the user would be able to use the app just by talking to his phone.
- Shopping list creation: a user would be able to create a shopping list using only voice commands.
- List relevance: the shopping list would be updated as the user would pickup products.
- Shopping drafts: it would be possible to save certain shopping lists as drafts to be used for future shoppings.
- Energy consumption minimization: while the app is running it would not use a lot of battery power in order to last through a whole shopping session.
- Product price recognition: the app would recognise the price of a product if it is visible with the product itself.
- Aisle recognition: the app would also be able to tell the user where he/she is in the shop.
